Course project towards course SA

## How to run it:

    python collect.py <number of tweets collected> <hashtag>

## note

As the limitation of RestAPI, we could only collect 45,000 tweets per 15 mins, therefore, for any query more than 45,000, please be patient to wait couple mins to finish.

If getting the response "no more", it means that we have collected most possible tweets in the last 7 days
